## 💡 Tips for Asking Questions

### ✅ Good Question Formats:
- **Direct factual**: "How many days of PTO?"
- **Process-oriented**: "How do I request time off?"
- **Policy questions**: "What is the dress code?"
- **Resource questions**: "What mental health resources are available?"

### ⚠️ Questions That Might Not Work Well:
- Questions about information NOT in the documents
- Very vague questions: "Tell me everything"
- Questions requiring calculations not in the docs
- Questions about future events or predictions

### 🎯 Best Practices:
1. **Be specific**: "How many days of PTO?" vs "Tell me about time off"
2. **Use keywords**: Include terms like "PTO", "VPN", "EAP" that appear in documents
3. **Ask follow-ups**: If the first answer isn't clear, ask a more specific question
4. **Try variations**: "What are working hours?" vs "When do I work?"
