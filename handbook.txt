Employee Handbook - Company Policies

Welcome to our company! This handbook contains important information about our policies and procedures.

WORKING HOURS
Our standard working hours are Monday through Friday, 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Flexible hours are available for employees who discuss arrangements with their manager in advance. Remote work is permitted up to three days per week for eligible positions.

LEAVE POLICY
All full-time employees accrue 15 days of paid time off (PTO) per year. PTO can be used for vacation, personal time, or sick leave. Unused PTO may be carried over up to 5 days to the next year. To request time off, submit a request through the HR portal at least two weeks in advance.

HEALTH INSURANCE
The company provides comprehensive health insurance coverage for all full-time employees. Coverage begins on the first day of employment. You can add dependents to your plan during open enrollment or within 30 days of a qualifying life event. Our current provider offers both HMO and PPO options.

EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT
Business expenses must be pre-approved by your manager for amounts over $100. Submit expense reports within 30 days of the expense date through the company portal. Receipts are required for all expenses over $25. Reimbursements are processed on the 15th and last day of each month.

CODE OF CONDUCT
All employees are expected to maintain the highest standards of professional conduct. This includes treating colleagues with respect, maintaining confidentiality of company information, and avoiding conflicts of interest. Any concerns about conduct should be reported to HR immediately.

PERFORMANCE REVIEWS
Annual performance reviews are conducted in December. Employees should document their accomplishments throughout the year. Reviews include self-evaluations, manager feedback, and goal-setting for the upcoming year. Mid-year check-ins are available upon request.

DRESS CODE
Our dress code is business casual. Jeans are acceptable except when meeting with external clients or attending formal company events. Use good judgment and dress appropriately for your role and the day's activities.

EQUIPMENT AND SECURITY
Company-issued laptops and phones must be used in accordance with our IT security policy. Never share passwords or leave devices unattended. Report lost or stolen equipment immediately to IT. All company data must be stored on approved cloud services, not personal devices.
